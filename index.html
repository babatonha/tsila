                    who anticipates that it will take more than one hour to arrive at the meeting point should telephone our control
                     office to inform us of the delay. Where a passenger does not alert us of a delay, we will check with the airport 
                     authorities. If we do not hear from a passenger 2 hours after a flight has landed, this will be charged as a no show.</p>
